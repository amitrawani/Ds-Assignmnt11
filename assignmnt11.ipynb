    "Ans. The function used to open a file in Python is open(). It takes the filename as a parameter and returns a file object that can be used to \n",
    "perform various operations on the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read mode('r'): This is the default mode for opening a file. It allows reading data from the file but does not allow any modifications. \n",
    "If the file does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write mode('w'): This mode is used to write data to a file. It creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates the existing file. \n",
    "If the file already exists, the previous contents are deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Append mode('a'): This mode is used to append data to an existing file. The file is not truncated, and new data is added to the end of the file. \n",
    "If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Exclusive creation mode('x'): This mode is used to create a new file but raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Binary mode('b'): This mode is used for binary file operations. It can be added to any of the above modes to indicate that the file should be \n",
    "treated as a binary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Text mode('t'): This mode is the default mode for text file operations. It can be added to any of the above modes to indicate that \n",
    "the file should be treated as a text file. "

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The close() function is used to close a file in Python. It is important to close a file  because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Closing a file releases the resources associated with the file, such as memory buffers and system handles. Failing to close a file can lead \n",
    "to resource leaks and can impact the performance of your program.\n",
    "2. Closing a file ensures that any pending writes are flushed to the disk. If you don't close the file, the data may not be written completely,\n",
    "leading to data loss or corruption.\n",
    "3. Closing a file allows other programs or processes to access the file. If a file is left open, it may be locked and inaccessible to other programs."
